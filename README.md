# CycleMe Mobile App

## Introduction
CycleMe is a mobile application that empowers users to classify waste based on pictures they capture or upload. Once a photo is uploaded, the app will identify the waste type and provide recommendations on recycled products tutorials. The app requires camera access and an active internet connection. With CycleMe, users can share their recycling journey through the Feed feature, where they can post images and videos accompanied by captions. By uploading an image to the Feed, users will earn points that can be redeemed for exciting rewards. Moreover, users can engage with one another by leaving comments on posts. We highly value user feedback as it contributes to the ongoing improvement of our application. We hope you enjoy your experience with CycleMe!
